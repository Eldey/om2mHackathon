# om2mHackathon
This is the respository of the om2mHackathon @Wollongong.

This hackathon aims to imagine new applications that a smart city
could offer its citizens, its elected officials or its technical and
administrative services in a multi-domain vision based on the
oneM2M standard.

The two day event will involve a day of developers tutorials followed
by the hackathon. In entering in this hackathon, participants will be
challenged to come up with innovative ideas, work with others to
learn new technologies, present your ideas and compete for prizes.

EVENT COST: FREE

VENUE: SMART BUILDING 6, FOYER

4 - Select the board: Tools -> Board -> NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)

### Simulation: Digital Twin of the SMART Infrastructure Buidling.

The simulation has two components:
* A middleware based on oneM2M managing the simulation and the sensors
* A 3D visualisation of the SMART Infrastructure Building 

#### Quick start
