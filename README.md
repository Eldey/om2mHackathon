# om2mHackathon@Wollongong
This hackathon aims to imagine new applications that a smart city
could offer its citizens, its elected officials or its technical and
administrative services in a multi-domain vision based on the
oneM2M standard.

The two day event will involve a day of developers tutorials followed
by the hackathon. In entering in this hackathon, participants will be
challenged to come up with innovative ideas, work with others to
learn new technologies, present your ideas and compete for prizes.

EVENT COST: FREE

VENUE: SMART BUILDING 6, FOYER

WEDNESDAY 8 MAY - 9.30AM - 5.00PM | THURSDSAY 9 MAY - 8.30AM - 5.00PM

Hosted by the SMART Infrastructure Facility

This hackathon is supported by funding from ETSI, SMART, and LAAS-CNRS.

## Programming with NodeMCU


1 - Get and install the Arduino IDE : https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software

2 - Launch the Arduino IDE

3 - Under File -> Preferences -> Additional Boards Manager URLs, adds http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json and validate.

4 - Select the board: Tools -> Board -> NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)

## Simulation: Digital Twin of the SMART Infrastructure Buidling.

The simulation has two components:
* A middleware based on oneM2M managing the simulation and the sensors
* A 3D visualisation of the SMART Infrastructure Building 

### Quick start
####  Requirements

```powershell
JAVA Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 (not compatible with JAVA 11)
```
#### Launching the simulation on Windows

1. Download the middleware: [Download](https://github.com/Eldey/om2mHackathon/blob/master/IPE/x86_64.zip)
2. Extract the file content of the file x86_64.zip 
3. Execute the file start.bat

### Launching the simulation on Linux

1. Download, unzip and launch the middleware:
```powershell
wget "https://github.com/Eldey/om2mHackathon/blob/master/IPE/x86_64.zip"
mkdir IPE
unzip x86_64.zip -d /IPE
cd IPE/x86_64
java -jar -ea -Declipse.ignoreApp=true -Dosgi.clean=true -Ddebug=true plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.3.0.v20140415-2008.jar -console -noExit
```

2. Download, unzip and launch the 3D Visualisatin:
```powershell
wget "https://github.com/Eldey/om2mHackathon/blob/master/Digital%20Twin/Linux_UOW_SMART_Hackathon_V1.3.zip"
mkdir Simulation
unzip Linux_UOW_SMART_Hackathon_V1.3.zip -d /Simulation
sudo chmod +x Simulation/UOW\ SMART\ Hackathon\ -\ Linux\ -\ V1.3.x86_64
./Simulation/UOW\ SMART\ Hackathon\ -\ Linux\ -\ V1.3.x86_64
```
3. [Optional]: Configure your screen resolution, graphics quality.
4. Press the Play! button.

### How it works

There are two components:
* A 3D visualisation of the SMART Infrastructure building build with Unity3D.
* A middleware based on [OM2M](https://www.eclipse.org/om2m/)

The middleware is the core of the simulation, it manages all the parameters of the simulation and the simulated sensors. Every X seconds, the simulation asks the middleware for the current state of the devices and update itself. At any time, request can be sent to the middleware to get information about a sensor or control the simulation.

The following picture illustrate this architecture:

![](https://github.com/Eldey/om2mHackathon/blob/master/img/how_it_works.PNG)

### What are the simulation parameters:


| Name        | Description          
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| TimeOfDay     | The current simulation time. It is an integer between [0..1440] corresponding to the number of minutes since midnight  | 
| RefreshRate      | The frequency at which the simulation is updating. It is a float point number for seconds.    |  
| Population      | The number of simulated occupants within the building.    | 

### What is simulated:

The simulation simulates a day/night cycle.

Each of the building rooms are equipped with:
 1. A light.
 2. An automatic door.
 3. An automatic window.
 4. A movement sensor.
 
 
 Not all rooms have a door and a window, but all of them have at least a light. 
 
 The movement sensors react to events happening in the simulation. 
 
 ### What you can do:
 
An [API](https://github.com/Eldey/om2mHackathon/tree/master/API) allows you to control the simulation parameters and the current state of all the simulated sensors for each rooms. 

Basically, the [API](https://github.com/Eldey/om2mHackathon/tree/master/API) gives you two types of operations: 
* GET : to get the current state of a sensor or a parameter.
* SET : to change the current state of a sensor or a parameter.
